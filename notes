angular : javascript framework
react : it is javascript library it can use both js and typescript as language

s/w prequisite
-node.js
-npm
-editor

there are two ways to create react

1. npx : there is no need to install configuration file. These are the files which support us to create the react project
   commands :
   Step 1: -npx create-react-app-appname
   Step 2: -cd appname
   Step 3: -npm start
2. npm : In this first we have to install configuration file.
   Step 1: -npm i -g create-react-app
   Step 2 :-create-react-app appname
   Step 2: -cd appname
   Step 3: -npm start

-all external & required libraries we download are found in node_modules.it;s installations are done here.
-libraries and dependies we install are found in package.json

-how do you display the an individual component's output by using that component's selector as a tag.

In react,there are two types of components
1.Function component
2.Class component

// to create a arrow function this is the syntax
const FunctionComp = () => { }

//to create a normal function the syntax is
function FunctionComp(){}s

\*what is react
-it is javascript library
-angular is a javascript framework

-what is the difference between library and framework
Library:
A library is a collection of reusable code that you can call upon to perform specific tasks.
You control the flow of the application and decide when and how to use the library.
Example: React (a library for building UI components).
Framework:
A framework provides a structure and set of rules for building an application.
The framework is in control and calls your code at certain points.
Example: Angular (a framework for building web applications).
Key Difference:

Who is in control?
In a library, you call the library.
In a framework, the framework calls you (Inversion of Control).

Framework is like a dmart shop it has everything in a single building, you don't need to download anything from externally
But library is like a kirana shop it serves specific needs doesn not have everything under one roof.

\*what is the purpose of react library
-it is used to create rich UI.
-it is used to create single page application.

React is more popular and used today than angular
what is the difference between react and angular if both can do the same thing
Parameter || Angular || React ||
Language || Typescript,Html || XML,Javascript ||
DataBinding || Two-way Databinding || One-way data-binding
DOM || Real DOM || Virtual DOM
Invention || Google || Facebook

In XML, all elements must be closed even if it is paired or unpaired.
you achieve two-way data binding in angular via ng model directory.
In react there is only one-way data-binding.

\*App is root component in react project
component is a reusuable block code of the project or partial part of webapp
it is a fundamental logical block which we can reuse in our whole project easily.
we can reuse it multiple times.
it can be any part of react app.

In react,there are two types of components
1.Function component - we use this component when your main focus is on UI design in that case we use function component
2.Class component - we use this component when you need to deal with complex logic with design.

Note: while creating component it's file name must start with capital letters
-Function component may return a value class component never returns a value
-we use render method in class component to return data.

-we can close tags like this also instead of opening and closing tag.
<FunctionComp/>>
<ClassComp/>

-What is JSX
it is a combination of javascript and xml : it makes react code easy to write as well as it allows us to write HTML code in react component
In jsx In component to wrap multiple element we have to use one parent element it must be your block element and not an inline element like use div it's a block element.
It can be h1-h6 elements they're also block elements.

Props :
Props is used to pass data inside component and props
-it return us object type of data
-we write props in starting tag of component in key and value pair format
-we can access props in class component by writing this.props.propsName

-this is the destructuring of props in function component

-const {empName,post} =props; //destructuring of props
return( <div>

<h2>This is function component</h2>
{/_ <p>My name is <strong>{props.empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{props.post}</strong></p> _/}
<p>My name is <strong>{empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{post}</strong></p>
</div>)

--this is the destructuring of props in class component

-const {empName,post} = this.props //destructuring of
return (<div>

<h2>This is a Class Component</h2>
{/_ <p>My name is <strong>{this.props.empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{this.props.post}</strong></p> _/}
<p>My name is <strong>{empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{post}</strong></p>
</div>)

--you can also do destructing of props in function component when defining the function like this :
const FunctionComp = ({empName,post}) => {} //you directly define props you want to pass.
instead of this
const FunctionComp = (props) => {}

\*Method and Event in React
Method is nothing but a function in react,now you can implement that function in existing and new components.

create a function component namely MyEventComp

\*when we create a arrow function we don't use function keyword we use const instead of it.
const MyEventComp () => {} //we use const so as to not a create a duplicate component like it and also we don't wanna change it's value at runtime.

\*If you want to create a method in function component make sure that in a arrow function you have to create a arrow function only and not a normal function, a normal function won't execute
