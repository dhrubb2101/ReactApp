angular : javascript framework
react : it is javascript library it can use both js and typescript as language

s/w prequisite
-node.js
-npm
-editor

there are two ways to create react

1. npx : there is no need to install configuration file. These are the files which support us to create the react project
   commands :
   Step 1: -npx create-react-app-appname
   Step 2: -cd appname
   Step 3: -npm start
2. npm : In this first we have to install configuration file.
   Step 1: -npm i -g create-react-app
   Step 2 :-create-react-app appname
   Step 2: -cd appname
   Step 3: -npm start

-all external & required libraries we download are found in node_modules.it;s installations are done here.
-libraries and dependies we install are found in package.json

-how do you display the an individual component's output by using that component's selector as a tag.

In react,there are two types of components
1.Function component
2.Class component

// to create a arrow function this is the syntax
const FunctionComp = () => { }

//to create a normal function the syntax is
function FunctionComp(){}s

\*what is react
-it is javascript library
-angular is a javascript framework

-what is the difference between library and framework
Library:
A library is a collection of reusable code that you can call upon to perform specific tasks.
You control the flow of the application and decide when and how to use the library.
Example: React (a library for building UI components).
Framework:
A framework provides a structure and set of rules for building an application.
The framework is in control and calls your code at certain points.
Example: Angular (a framework for building web applications).
Key Difference:

Who is in control?
In a library, you call the library.
In a framework, the framework calls you (Inversion of Control).

Framework is like a dmart shop it has everything in a single building, you don't need to download anything from externally
But library is like a kirana shop it serves specific needs doesn not have everything under one roof.

\*what is the purpose of react library
-it is used to create rich UI.
-it is used to create single page application.

React is more popular and used today than angular
what is the difference between react and angular if both can do the same thing
Parameter || Angular || React ||
Language || Typescript,Html || XML,Javascript ||
DataBinding || Two-way Databinding || One-way data-binding
DOM || Real DOM || Virtual DOM
Invention || Google || Facebook

In XML, all elements must be closed even if it is paired or unpaired.
you achieve two-way data binding in angular via ng model directory.
In react there is only one-way data-binding.

\*App is root component in react project
component is a reusuable block code of the project or partial part of webapp
it is a fundamental logical block which we can reuse in our whole project easily.
we can reuse it multiple times.
it can be any part of react app.

In react,there are two types of components
1.Function component - we use this component when your main focus is on UI design in that case we use function component
2.Class component - we use this component when you need to deal with complex logic with design.

Note: while creating component it's file name must start with capital letters
-Function component may return a value class component never returns a value
-we use render method in class component to return data.

-we can close tags like this also instead of opening and closing tag.
<FunctionComp/>>
<ClassComp/>

-What is JSX
it is a combination of javascript and xml : it makes react code easy to write as well as it allows us to write HTML code in react component
In jsx In component to wrap multiple element we have to use one parent element it must be your block element and not an inline element like use div it's a block element.
It can be h1-h6 elements they're also block elements.

Props :
Props is used to pass data inside component and props
-it return us object type of data
-we write props in starting tag of component in key and value pair format
-we can access props in class component by writing this.props.propsName

-this is the destructuring of props in function component

-const {empName,post} =props; //destructuring of props
return( <div>

<h2>This is function component</h2>
{/_ <p>My name is <strong>{props.empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{props.post}</strong></p> _/}
<p>My name is <strong>{empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{post}</strong></p>
</div>)

--this is the destructuring of props in class component

-const {empName,post} = this.props //destructuring of
return (<div>

<h2>This is a Class Component</h2>
{/_ <p>My name is <strong>{this.props.empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{this.props.post}</strong></p> _/}
<p>My name is <strong>{empName},</strong> I am a <strong>{post}</strong></p>
</div>)

--you can also do destructing of props in function component when defining the function like this :
const FunctionComp = ({empName,post}) => {} //you directly define props you want to pass.
instead of this
const FunctionComp = (props) => {}

\*Method and Event in React
Method is nothing but a function in react,now you can implement that function in existing and new components.

create a function component namely MyEventComp

\*when we create a arrow function we don't use function keyword we use const instead of it.
const MyEventComp () => {} //we use const so as to not a create a duplicate component like it and also we don't wanna change it's value at runtime.

\*If you want to create a method in function component make sure that in a arrow function you have to create a arrow function only and not a normal function, a normal function won't execute

\*MyEventTwoComp(class component)

--in class component when defining a function you cannot use const keyword
--in function component we can use it.

\*State :

- it is used to handle essential data in class component.
  -it returns object type of data
  -in class component we write state in constructor.
  \*By using hooks we can use state now in function component before react version 16 it was not possible to use state in function components
  we can access state data by writing this state.propertyname

Create a class component namely MyStateComp

State is used to store data

\*super method represents your parent class constructor

\*how to change state data
we use a method namely
setState : to update or change the state data in class component for setState method is used.

\*Create a class component MyInfoComp and pass props name,post,company,address, and contact and gender and display it on browser.
\*Create a class component MyCounterComp having state with count property and display it's value and you have to create three buttons which will incrememnt , decrement and reset counter value and display it's value.

\*we use props to pass that data inside your component from outide and with the help of state you can manipulate the data inside your component.
\*if you want to access state data outside your state you use this.state.propertyname

\*how to css within your react component
1.Internal CSS: In normal html in the starting tag we use style attribute and with it we use and write properties and values.
2.External CSS: In this we create a separate css file and import in componenet.
3.Module CSS: when we have css property for particular component in that case we use it. we can create module css file by writing filename.module.css

\*Create a component with name MyCSSComp

\*Create a CSS file named MyCSS.css

\*Create a class component with name MyImagesComp which will use images.

in this component we are inserting images for that we are importing them via storing their image path individually in variables then using those variablees in img tag individually for their use in an individual component
-this is not convenient cuz what if number of images are very high it'll just increase the lines of code.

so Instead of this we can create a constant file where we'll import the all images and we'll import the constant file in all the required components which require imported images.

*we just how to insert images and multimedia files
*how to access constant fata

Task 2: create class component with ToggleImgCom, in this task you have to toggle image with its name when you click on single button

\*conditional rendering : display component output or view on the basis condition
1.if else: if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else part
2.element as variable: In this we store data in a variable first and then we return that variable as an element.
3.use of ternary operator:It is a shorthand syntax for if/Else means sometime you want to display data or you want to check condition in a single line we use ternary operator.
Syntax: first check the condition and if the condition is true , the truepart will execute otherwise falsepart will execute.
Syntax : (conditon) ? truepart : falsepart;
4.short-circuit(&&): it will display element or component output only if condition is true.
//we use this for null checking purpose - that is when we fetch data from server and the data is not there in your variable so it won't render your DOM element and if there is data in your variable then you display it.

//basically in short-circuit data is not displayed if the condition is false it'll only get displayed if the if condition is true that's only when your DOM element gets rendered.

Create a class component ConditionalRenComp

\*use of extension for creating component in react

\*there's code snippet for boilerplate code for class and functional component:
type rce
rce (reactclasscomponentexport)

and by typing rconst inside you can generate boilerplate code for constructor with super method and state
so type rconst and press enter

\*There's a code snippet for boilerplate code for function component as well
we type in rfce

\*There's a code snippet for boilerplate code for arrow function component as well
we type in rafce

\*Component Interaction

Create Two component one with the name ParentComp it will be a class component
and ChildComp it will be a function component and you have to display the output of your parent component.

\*use extension for creating react component in react
rce: it will generate class component structure
rconst: it will generate class component structure
rfce: it will generate normal function component
rafce: it will generate arrow funtion component

if you want to build or create parent-child relation in betwenn components for this you have to import child component in parent component and write it's name as a tag in parent component.

\*make sure that whenever you're using methodname or variable in a class component you don't const or let keywords in function component we can do that.

\*props is basically used to pass data inside a component whether it is a chid component or parent component.

\*Create one more component with the name MyPureComp a class component.

\*whenever there is new data in class component the render method it gets executed automatically

\*Pure Components: It is a react component which prevent unnecessary re-rendering of class components.
-by performing shallow comparision it checks data if it is same then it prevent components to re-render
-to achieve this we have to extend class component with pure components
\*React.memo():It is a react method which prevent unnecessary re-rendering of function components.
-by performing shallow comparision it checks data if it is same then it prevent components to re-render.
-to achieve this you have to pass component name as an argument to react.memo() method.

\*how to avoid unnecessary re-rendering of child class components.

\*how to use bootstrap in react project.

Step 1: install bootstrap
npm i bootstrap
Step 2: import bootstrap path in index.js file

\*render array of object data in class component.
RenderListComp(cc) create a class component.

\*Virtual DOM concept: React is faster than angular due to this reason
whenever you are going to perform

\*angular performs manipulation with your browser DOM It's a real DOM so it's gonna take time to process and React creates same copy of browser DOM and all elements are gonna be present there
and it is created in memeory and it is known as virtual DOM and it works much faster than real DOM and if you change a single DOM only that particular will get rendered again others will stay same in react in virtual DOM ( that is other part of components will not get rendered just the part where you made the update)

Create a class component named ClickCounter(cc)
Create a class component named HoverCounter(cc)
it has a state with property count . Write a method where it will increment the counter value by 1 when you click on the button.
it has a state with property count . Write a method where it will increment the counter value by 1 when you hover your mouse on it.

HOC (Higher Order Component) : It is a technique which is used to share common business logic with multple components in the project
In HOC we share data or logic from function to class component. Here we pass data through props

Create HOC function component and display it's output and create class component within it.

Render props:
Render props is a design pattern in React that lets you share code between components by using a prop whose value is a function. Instead of hardcoding the UI, a component that uses render props delegates the rendering logic to the function provided as a prop. This pattern makes your components more flexible and reusable.

How Render Props Work
Component with State/Logic:
A component (for example, a Counter component) manages state or contains logic. Instead of rendering its own UI, it calls a function (passed as a prop) to determine what should be rendered.

Render Prop Function:
The render prop function receives relevant data (like state values or methods) as arguments and returns the UI to display.

Reusability:
Multiple components can use the same render prop component by providing different render functions, resulting in different UIs while reusing the same logic.

\*we're now going to learn form validation in react
